    "\n",
    "We propose an implementation of the paper \"Generalized sorting with predictions\" by Pinyan Lu, Xuandi Ren, Enze Sun, and Yubo Zhang (2020). The paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00172.pdf. To this date, 11th of April 2021, no coded implementation has already been proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present how the code is divided and the constraints associated to using this code.\n",
    "First, we generate a \"true\"/correct directed acyclic graph (DAG). Then, we run some code that will copy and modify the correct graph into a \"kind-of-similar\" graph, but with some mis-predicted edges. This is done in order to simulate a non-perfect prediction of the correct graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we can then infer the correct graph from the predicted graph, by comparing edges. The main purpose of the paper is to obtain the sorted elements by minimizing the amount of probed edges. The code below achieves the correct sorting through a randomized algorithm which uses $O(n\\log{n}+w)$ probings, where:  \n",

    "In this section we will create a correct directed graph. In addition, we will simulate a prediction of that graph by copying the correct and modifying some of the edges, in order to create some mispredicted edges. This will be useful for testing the implementation of the algorithm.\n",

    "Several functions are defined in the following cell:  \n",
    "- ```generate_graph(n, pc)```: will create a list of edges, where each edge is stored in a tuple.\n",
    "    - ```n```indicates the number of nodes that need to be contained in the graph.  \n",
    "    - ```pc``` can be seen as a factor of randomness (used to create a binomial distribution of probability ```pc```), used to create some random edges/relationships between some of the nodes.\n",
    "- ```create_mispredicted_graph```: will change the direction of some of the edges (generate mispredicted edges), based on a binomial experiment with probability ```ppred``` and a given graph (list of tuples). This is done by:\n",
    "    - 1. looping through the list of edges\n",
    "    - 2. For each edge (e.g. (a,b)), it performs a binomial experiment with probability ```ppred```\n",
    "    - 3. If the binomial experiment succeeds it keeps (a, b), else it replaces it by (b, a).\n",
    "   \n",
    "- ```convert_tuples_to_dict```: converts a list of tuples into a Python dictionary data type. The above functions are executed on a list of edges (i.e. list of tuples). In the algorithm, it is required to have some arguments in dictionary data type, hence those lists of tuples need to be converted. The dictionary will have as key the vertex, and as value a list containing all the in_neighbors of that vertex/key. Hence, as key-pairs we have vertex-in_neighbors.   \n",

    "Notes: \n",
    "- in the ```generate_graph``` function:  \n",
    "    - we create a graph with successive nodes (i.e. use ```vertex = list(range(1,n+1))``` to generate the nodes). If one wants to create non-successive nodes (e.g. a graph with only nodes [1, 4, 749, 9580]) it has to be done manually.\n",
    "    - always starts with node 1 (not 0!)  \n",
    "\n",

    "Later on, we will need to check if a path exists between two nodes of a (directed) graph. How that could be done is not assessed in the paper. We suggest two possibilities:\n",
    "- one is to create a matrix that will keep track of the known relations between the nodes of the matrix. The matrix would then need to be updated when a new node is added.\n",
    "- another one is to compute all possible paths in the graph starting from one of the nodes, and observing if at least one of those paths reaches the other node. This is more computationally intensive than the first solution, but relies on less assumptions.\n",

    "- For simplicity, we assume that the line numbers and column numbers of the matrix match the vertex' number. For instance, cell (1,2) of the matrix represents the edge (1,2) of the graph. Hence, cell (1,2) refers to the relation between vertex 1 and 2 (obviously 1<2). This has the advantage to facilitate the lookup in the matrix (see function Discovery). Note that already knowing the order of the nodes has no effect on the number of probes that need to be performed, which is the main goal of the paper (and code).  \n",

For instance, as we have the edge (1,2) mentioned in the upper right of the matrix and the edge in opposite direction (2,1) is wrong (because 1<2) and does not bring any additional information, it is not required to represent the lower left half of the matrix. In addition, an edge will always be probed before adding it to the matrix. Therefore, the new edge to add in the matrix will always be in the right direction (because of the ```probe``` function that will be explained later.  \n",

    "Here we propose an idea to implement the algorithm somewhat differently, this is more computationally intensive but also more suited for larger graphs, where a matrix would become too \"heavy\", and where the vertices are not assumed to be in a successive order.  \n",
    "We have based our implementation of the algorithm on the idea of having a matrix keeping track of the different edges that were added to A and easily computes/identifies a path between two different vertices. However, this approach has some drawbacks as well. Hence, another approach could consider having a function run over A (that would be under the form of a dictionary) and check all paths starting from a specific vertex, adding the paths to a list of all possible paths. If the two vertices are found to be in at least one same path (iterate over that list, and check if both are mentioned in a same path), we would know there is a partial order in A for those two vertices (they're comparable by transitivity). Hence, we can also use this technique to check for a (non)valid certificate 2 and a (non)valid condition 2 for ideal vertices. One such function could be of the form below and should be run once for each direction, i.e. if we wanted to check if there is a partial order between a and b (in A), we would have to run once with ```start_vertex = a``` and once with ```start_vertex = b``` in order to take both directions into consideration."
